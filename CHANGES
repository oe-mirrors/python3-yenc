version: 0.1
- Initial release.

version: 0.2
- Included patch from Michael Muller <mmuller@enduden.com> that fixes some 
possible buffer overflows, and some yEnc incompatibilities.
- A few enanchments in C code, mainly cosmetic (it should be a little faster
in encoding).
- Files opened in O_RDWR mode are now handled properly.
- yenc.i interface adapted to latest SWIG releases.
- Passing a file opened in a wrong mode now raises a ValueError (rather than
an AssertionError).
- encode()/decode() now accepts filenames and stdin/stdout as arguments.
- Reaching EOF while encoding/decoding no more raises an exception (it was
redundant since the number of encoded/decoded bytes were already returned),
this could break some implementations.
- Passing 0 to the encode o decode functions causes file to be encoded/decoded
up to EOF (this is made possible by the previous change).
 
version: 0.3
- Encoded lines now are correctly terminated with CRLF.
- Encoded lines size now is 128 chars.
- using fread() instead of fgets in decode() function (much faster).
- SWIG isn't used anymore for wrapper generation.

version: 0.4
- change license to LGPL
- crc32 codes are now Python longs (returned from _yenc calls) in the range [2**0, 2**32 -1]
- crc32 formatting is fixed
- 'bytes' arguments named 'bytez' to avoid collision with 'bytes' type
- basic unit testing
- unescaped dots at the beginning of line caused ydecode to fail under some circumstances
  dots at the beginning of line are now always escaped 
- Encoder's and Decoder's output files (if any) are automatically flushed and closed upon deletion
- new method close() on Encoder and Decoder
